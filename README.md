# Environmental_assesment_training
 Group project(in progress, has not been completed yet)
 <br>
 ### Brief Descripition
For this group project, we were paired up with a professor from the Microbiology department to create an educational game for environmental assessment training for his students. The proposed idea was a puzzle game, where the student must go to a company, and perform an environmental impact report.  The aspect of the game I oversaw was the environmental impact from transportation.  Depending on the commute distance, and car type of each employee, the player must suggest carpool groups and bus passes to all employees.  This required an interactable 2D map, which can calculate shortest path from the employee to work.  In addition, allow user to assign carpool groups, which re-calculates shortest distance for each carpool group.
